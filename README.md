# DNS Spoofing & Credential Harvesting Lab

This project demonstrates a **DNS Spoofing attack** combined with **ARP poisoning** to redirect a victim to a fake banking site and harvest login credentials. The lab was conducted in a controlled environment using Kali Linux on VirtualBox.

## Lab Setup

- **Host**: Kali Linux (Attacker)
- **Victim**: Another Kali Linux VM
- **Network**: Bridged Adapter (same subnet)
- **Spoofed Domain**: `fakebank.com`
- **Spoofed IP**: `192.168.1.4` (attacker)
- **Tools Used**:
  - `ettercap` for ARP poisoning
  - `dnsspoof` for DNS spoofing
  - Apache2 web server with a fake login page
